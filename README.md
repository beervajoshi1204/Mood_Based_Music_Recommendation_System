#🎵Mood_Based_Music_Recommendation_System

A Streamlit-based AI project that detects human emotion from an image or webcam feed and recommends music accordingly — giving users a personalized, emotion-aware listening experience.

#❗ Problem with Today’s Music Recommendation Systems
Most popular music platforms rely heavily on a user's listening history, search behavior, and similar user preferences. Although effective to some extent, these systems suffer from major limitations:
  1. Not Emotion-Aware
  2. Biased Toward Past Behavior
  3. User Has to Do Manual Work
